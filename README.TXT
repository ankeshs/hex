Compile: javac *.java
Execute game: java HexGame

A strategy game called Hex that I implemented as my summer project, 2010, under Programming Club, IIT Kanpur. The game involves two players and is played on Grid of Hexagons. The objective of the game is to connect the opposite margins via beads of the same color.The game was invented by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein, who introduced the game in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute, and also independently invented by the mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University, who also proved that the game cannot end ina tie and there exists a winning strategy for the first player.

The frontend of the game is built using AWT/JFC Swing libraries, while the AI development essentially utilizes basic Graph theory algorithms viz Dijkstra's algorithm and Edmonds Karp algorithm.
